# Clinical-Mind

**Master clinical reasoning, one case at a time.**

An AI-powered clinical reasoning simulator that helps Indian medical students develop expert-level diagnostic thinking by exposing cognitive biases, providing Socratic feedback, and creating realistic case scenarios.

## Problem

Medical students can memorize and answer MCQs, but struggle with real clinical reasoning:
- **Invisible cognitive biases** (anchoring, premature closure, availability)
- **Can't explain reasoning** when attendings ask "Why?"
- **No practice under pressure** - freeze in real emergencies
- **Can't see knowledge connections** between concepts
- **Textbook cases ≠ Indian reality** (dengue, TB, resource constraints)

## Solution

Clinical-Mind is a multi-layered reasoning development platform:

1. **RAG-Powered Case Generation** - Dynamic cases from Indian medical literature
2. **Socratic AI Tutor** - Multi-turn dialogue that asks "why" until deep understanding
3. **Cognitive Bias Detection** - Tracks patterns across 20+ cases, identifies biases
4. **Knowledge Graph Visualization** - Interactive D3.js map of concept mastery
5. **Performance Analytics** - Personalized dashboard with peer benchmarking
6. **India-Centric Content** - Cases set in Indian hospitals with regional disease patterns

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| Visualization | D3.js (knowledge graph), Recharts (analytics) |
| Backend | Python 3.11+, FastAPI |
| AI Engine | Claude Opus 4.6 (Anthropic API) |
| Vector DB | ChromaDB + LangChain |
| Embeddings | Sentence-Transformers |

## Quick Start

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

## Design Philosophy

Inspired by Honest Greens + Linear:
- **Warm, organic palette** (cream backgrounds, forest greens, terracotta accents)
- **Larger typography** (18px body minimum for long study sessions)
- **Generous spacing** and smooth transitions (400ms ease-out)
- **Premium but approachable** - professional without being intimidating

## Hackathon

Built for **Problem Statement #3: "Amplify Human Judgment"**
- AI sharpens medical expertise without replacing it
- Makes students dramatically more capable
- Keeps humans in the loop
