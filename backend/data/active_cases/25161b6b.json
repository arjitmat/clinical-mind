For the past 5 days, he has developed difficulty initiating urination requiring catheterization once in the local PHC. He also reports a 3-week history of persistent hiccups that have not responded to home remedies.",

Binocular vertical diplopia began 4 weeks ago, worse on looking to the right. Intractable hiccups for 3 weeks \u2014 persistent, occurring throughout the day and disrupting sleep, not responsive to metoclopramide. Nausea and episodic vomiting for 2 weeks, not related to food intake, projectile at times. Urinary retention for 5 days, required catheterization once. Excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia) for 2 weeks \u2014 sleeping 14-16 hours/day. No headache, no seizures, no limb weakness, no sensory symptoms in limbs. One year ago, he had a 2-week episode of numbness and band-like tightness around his trunk at the level of the umbilicus that resolved spontaneously \u2014 he did not seek medical attention. No fever, no weight loss, no joint pains, no oral/genital ulcers, no skin rashes. No history of optic neuritis or limb weakness previously. Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use. No family history of neurological disease. Vegetarian. No recent travel. No tuberculosis contact."

      "Area postrema syndrome (intractable hiccups, nausea, vomiting) is a core clinical characteristic of NMOSD and may be the presenting or sole feature \u2014 this is NOT a typical MS presentation and should raise immediate suspicion for NMOSD.",
      "NMOSD 2015 diagnostic criteria require at least one core clinical characteristic (optic neuritis, acute myelitis, area postrema syndrome, brainstem syndrome, diencephalic syndrome, or cerebral syndrome) with AQP4-IgG positivity. Seronegative NMOSD requires additional stringent criteria.",
      "Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM \u22653 vertebral segments) with central cord involvement is characteristic of NMOSD, whereas MS typically produces short-segment, peripheral/dorsal cord lesions. Bilateral INO can occur in both MS and NMOSD but the WEBINO pattern with area postrema involvement strongly favors NMOSD.",
      "Treatment of NMOSD differs critically from MS: Acute attacks require high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1g x 5 days) followed by plasma exchange if poor response. Long-term immunosuppression with rituximab, azathioprine, or mycophenolate is the mainstay \u2014 interferon-beta and fingolimod (MS drugs) can WORSEN NMOSD."
    ],
    "atypical_features": "This case is challenging because (1) the presenting symptom of intractable hiccups is easily dismissed as a non-neurological complaint, delaying diagnosis; (2) there is no optic neuritis \u2014 the most commonly recognized NMOSD feature \u2014 forcing clinicians to recognize area postrema syndrome and brainstem syndromes as core NMOSD presentations; (3) bilateral INO (WEBINO) overlaps with MS but the combination with area postrema lesion, LETM, hypersomnia (diencephalic involvement), and absence of oligoclonal bands should redirect toward NMOSD; (4) the prior episode of band-like truncal sensory symptoms likely represents an undiagnosed myelitis episode, establishing relapsing disease; (5) distinction from MS is critical as MS-specific therapies can exacerbate NMOSD.",
