He also reports new-onset urinary urgency and occasional incontinence for 2 weeks. His wife has noticed that his speech has become slightly slurred over the past month.",

He has fallen 6-7 times in the last month. He reports urinary urgency and frequency for 2 weeks with 2 episodes of urge incontinence. He denies visual symptoms, limb weakness, or sensory disturbances. His speech has become 'thick' per his wife. He reports erectile dysfunction for 4 months. He also describes episodic dizziness on standing from a seated position for the past 2 months. No headache, no seizures, no cognitive decline. He had an episode of syncopal attack 6 weeks ago while standing in a bank queue. No family history of neurological disease. No alcohol or substance use. No prior significant illness. He was prescribed sildenafil by a local doctor for ED, which caused a severe hypotensive episode. No exposure to toxins or drugs causing parkinsonism. He has noticed mild stiffness in both limbs but no tremor at any time. He was initially seen by a urologist who found no urological cause for his symptoms."

      "MSA is characterized by the triad of cerebellar ataxia or parkinsonism + severe autonomic failure + pyramidal signs; MSA-C (formerly sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy) predominates with cerebellar features while MSA-P (formerly Shy-Drager/striatonigral degeneration) with parkinsonism",
      "The 'hot cross bun' sign on pontine T2 MRI is characteristic (though not pathognomonic) of MSA-C, caused by selective neuronal loss in pontine nuclei and preserved pontine tegmentum and raphe; slit-like putaminal hyperintensity suggests MSA-P overlap",
      "Red flags distinguishing MSA from Parkinson's disease include: rapid progression, poor levodopa response, early severe autonomic failure (orthostatic hypotension >30 mmHg systolic within 3 minutes of standing, urinary incontinence), symmetric presentation, absence of rest tremor, cerebellar signs, and denervation on sphincter EMG (Onuf's nucleus involvement is highly specific for MSA)",
      "MSA carries a poor prognosis (median survival 6-9 years from symptom onset) with no disease-modifying therapy; management is symptomatic \u2014 midodrine/fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension, intermittent catheterization for urinary retention, physiotherapy for ataxia; levodopa trial is warranted but response is typically poor or transient"
    ],
    "atypical_features": "Young age of onset (34 years, whereas MSA typically presents at 50-60 years) requiring thorough exclusion of hereditary ataxias and treatable causes; the initial presentation mimicking a urological or spinal cord disorder leading to diagnostic delay; absence of any tremor throughout the course making initial parkinsonism assessment difficult; the combination of cerebellar, pyramidal, and autonomic features at a young age creates a wide differential including hereditary ataxias, demyelinating disease, and paraneoplastic syndromes; the symmetric bilateral DaTSCAN reduction without classic parkinsonian rest tremor adds complexity to the diagnostic workup",
