        "info": "The patient describes progressive fatigue and lethargy for 4 months that has affected his work performance. He developed pain, stiffness, and mild swelling of the 2nd and 3rd MCP joints bilaterally about 3 months ago, initially attributed to 'arthritis' by a local practitioner who prescribed NSAIDs with partial relief. He noticed generalized darkening of skin, especially prominent over exposed areas and in the axillae and groin. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 2 months ago (fasting glucose 210 mg/dL) and started on metformin 500 mg BD. His BMI is 23. He reports decreased libido and occasional erectile dysfunction for the past 6 months. He consumes alcohol socially (2-3 drinks per month). No history of blood transfusions. No known liver disease. No family history of diabetes, liver disease, or joint disease. No iron supplementation or tonic intake. He is vegetarian. He reports mild right upper quadrant discomfort after meals for the last month. No jaundice, no hematemesis, no melena. He has noticed slight reduction in body hair over the chest."

      "The classic triad of hereditary hemochromatosis is cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and skin pigmentation ('bronze diabetes'), but early presentations may be subtle \u2014 fatigue, arthralgia, and new-onset diabetes in a non-obese patient without family history should raise suspicion.",
      "Transferrin saturation >45% is the best initial screening test for hemochromatosis; serum ferritin indicates iron burden. Fasting transferrin saturation is more specific than ferritin alone, which is an acute phase reactant.",
      "Arthropathy of hemochromatosis characteristically involves the 2nd and 3rd MCP joints with chondrocalcinosis (CPPD deposition), and may be the presenting feature \u2014 it mimics but is distinct from rheumatoid arthritis (RF and anti-CCP negative).",
      "Treatment is serial phlebotomy (removal of 500 mL blood weekly) aiming for serum ferritin <50 ng/mL, followed by maintenance phlebotomy every 2-3 months. Arthropathy and hypogonadism may not fully reverse even with iron depletion. First-degree relatives must be screened."
    ],
    "atypical_features": "This case is challenging because hereditary hemochromatosis is considered rare in India and is often not suspected. The patient presents with a constellation of seemingly unrelated problems \u2014 new-onset diabetes without typical risk factors, arthropathy mimicking RA or gout, skin hyperpigmentation that could be dismissed as constitutional, and hypogonadism \u2014 requiring the student to connect these disparate findings through a unifying diagnosis. The MCP joint involvement with chondrocalcinosis is a strong clue that may be overlooked. Additionally, C282Y homozygosity is uncommon in Indian populations compared to Northern Europeans, making this a diagnostic challenge requiring awareness that HFE mutations, though less frequent, do occur in the Indian subcontinent.",
