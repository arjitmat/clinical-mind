He was found to have a serum calcium of 13.2 mg/dL during his last emergency visit for renal colic.",

Diffuse bone pain for 6 months \u2014 worse in lower limbs and lower back, progressive, not relieved by OTC analgesics. Constipation for 4 months (passes stool every 3-4 days). Increased thirst and polyuria (drinks ~4-5 liters/day). Decreased appetite, occasional nausea, 4 kg weight loss. Difficulty concentrating at work, feels 'mentally foggy,' low mood. No history of malignancy, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, or prolonged immobilization. Not taking any calcium, vitamin D, antacids, lithium, or thiazide diuretics. No family history of kidney stones or endocrine disorders. Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use. Diet: Predominantly vegetarian."

No neck swelling or palpable thyroid nodule \u2014 however, careful palpation reveals a firm, non-tender 1.5 cm nodule just inferior and posterior to the left lower pole of thyroid. Musculoskeletal: Diffuse bony tenderness on palpation of tibia and lumbar spine. Proximal muscle weakness (difficulty rising from squatting \u2014 positive Gower-like sign). No joint swelling. Abdomen: Mild left renal angle tenderness. No hepatosplenomegaly. Neuropsychiatric: Slightly slow mentation, no focal neurological deficits. No band keratopathy on gross inspection."

Intact PTH: 285 pg/mL (markedly elevated; normal 10-65). Alkaline phosphatase: 420 U/L (elevated; normal 44-147). 24-hour urine calcium: 480 mg/day (elevated; normal <250).

CT KUB: Bilateral renal calculi (left 8 mm mid-ureteric, right 5 mm lower pole, both calcium-containing). X-ray hands: Subperiosteal resorption along radial aspect of middle phalanges. X-ray skull: 'Salt and pepper' appearance (osteitis fibrosa cystica). DEXA scan: T-score -3.1 at lumbar spine (osteoporosis), -2.8 at distal 1/3 radius. Tc-99m Sestamibi scan: Focal increased tracer uptake persisting in delayed images at left inferior parathyroid region, consistent with parathyroid adenoma.

    "learning_points": [
      "Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is characterized by elevated calcium with inappropriately elevated or non-suppressed PTH \u2014 this combination is the diagnostic hallmark. Simultaneously elevated calcium + PTH essentially clinches the diagnosis.",
      "The classic clinical tetrad is 'bones (osteitis fibrosa cystica, fractures), stones (nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis), abdominal groans (constipation, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer), and psychic moans (depression, confusion, fatigue).' Indian patients tend to present with more severe skeletal and renal disease compared to Western populations.",
      "Concurrent vitamin D deficiency (extremely common in India) can mask the severity of hypercalcemia in PHPT and paradoxically worsen bone disease by further stimulating PTH. Vitamin D should be cautiously repleted preoperatively while monitoring calcium closely.",
      "Tc-99m Sestamibi parathyroid scan combined with neck ultrasound is the standard preoperative localization strategy. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy with intraoperative PTH monitoring is the treatment of choice. Post-surgery, watch for 'hungry bone syndrome' \u2014 severe hypocalcemia due to rapid bone remineralization."
    ],
    "atypical_features": "This case is challenging because: (1) The coexistent vitamin D deficiency (very common in Indian vegetarian population) complicates the biochemical picture \u2014 phosphorus is very low and ALP very high, suggesting severe skeletal involvement amplified by vitamin D deficiency on top of PHPT; (2) The mildly elevated creatinine raises the question of whether this is primary or secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism from renal disease, requiring careful reasoning; (3) The patient presents with the full 'bones, stones, groans, moans' phenotype which is now more commonly seen in India than in Western countries where PHPT is detected incidentally \u2014 students must recognize this classic but increasingly rare full-blown presentation; (4) The hypertension is an underappreciated association with PHPT that may confuse the clinical picture.",
