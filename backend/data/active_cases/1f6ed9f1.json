He has associated severe headache, nausea, and two episodes of non-bilious vomiting. He reports myalgia and fatigue between febrile episodes. He stayed in his village near a tea garden in upper Assam for 10 days, where he slept without a mosquito net. No history of diarrhea, cough, rash, or urinary symptoms. No history of recent antibiotic use. No known chronic illnesses. No history of similar illness in the past. No IV drug use. He is a non-smoker and occasional social drinker.

The periodicity of fever (alternate-day pattern), characteristic peripheral smear findings (Sch\u00fcffner's stippling, enlarged RBCs), mild splenomegaly, and relevant epidemiological exposure make the diagnosis relatively straightforward, testing the student's ability to correlate history, examination, and lab findings systematically.",
