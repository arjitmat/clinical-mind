        "info": "The patient first noticed stiffness and clumsiness in his left leg 6 weeks ago, which progressed to involve the right leg over 3 weeks. He now requires support to walk and has fallen 5-6 times. Urinary urgency started 10 days ago with 2 episodes of urge incontinence. His wife notes personality changes \u2014 he has become apathetic, occasionally inappropriately laughing, and forgetful (missed bill payments, forgot his daughter's school event). He reports intermittent electric shock-like sensations down both arms when bending his neck (Lhermitte sign) for the past 3 weeks. He had an episode of transient blurring of vision in the left eye about 2 years ago lasting 10 days, which he attributed to 'eye strain' and never investigated. No headache, no seizures, no fever. He also recalls a 3-week episode of numbness and band-like tightness around his trunk at the level of the umbilicus approximately 14 months ago that resolved without treatment. He is a non-smoker, occasional alcohol use. No family history of neurological illness. No recent travel. No history of tuberculosis or contact. He was treated empirically for 'cervical spondylosis' by a local practitioner 4 weeks ago with analgesics and physiotherapy without improvement. No history of recurrent oral ulcers, joint pains, rashes, or dryness of eyes/mouth."

      "Bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) in a young patient is highly suggestive of multiple sclerosis \u2014 it localizes to the medial longitudinal fasciculus in the dorsal pons/midbrain and is uncommon in vascular disease at this age.",
      "Transition from RRMS to SPMS is characterized by progressive neurological decline (especially myelopathy) independent of relapses \u2014 early recognition and treatment of RRMS prevents this transition. Many Indian patients present late due to spontaneous resolution of initial relapses without investigation.",
      "McDonald 2017 criteria allow diagnosis at the first clinical event if MRI shows dissemination in space (periventricular + juxtacortical + infratentorial + spinal cord) and time (simultaneous enhancing and non-enhancing lesions). CSF oligoclonal bands can substitute for dissemination in time.",
      "Anti-AQP4 and anti-MOG antibody testing is critical in the Indian context where NMOSD is relatively more prevalent than in Western populations \u2014 treatment strategies differ significantly (rituximab for NMOSD vs. interferon-beta/natalizumab/ocrelizumab for MS). Short-segment lateral cord lesions favor MS, while LETM (\u22653 segments) and central cord involvement favor NMOSD."
    ],
    "atypical_features": "This case is challenging because the patient presents with progressive myelopathy mimicking cervical spondylotic myelopathy (a common misdiagnosis in India), with cognitive-behavioral changes suggesting frontal lobe involvement. The bilateral INO \u2014 a critical clinical clue \u2014 could be missed if ocular motility examination is not performed carefully. The history of prior unrecognized relapses (optic neuritis attributed to eye strain, transverse myelitis episode that self-resolved) requires careful retrospective elicitation. The transition to secondary progressive phase without prior MS diagnosis reflects real-world diagnostic delays in the Indian healthcare system. Additionally, the frontal cognitive impairment and personality changes at age 34 raise concern for neurodegenerative or psychiatric conditions, adding diagnostic complexity.",
