He appears thin and anxious about his symptoms.",

        "info": "The patient reports a productive cough for 6 weeks that has gradually worsened. Initially mucopurulent sputum, but for the past 10 days he has noticed intermittent blood streaks in the sputum (approximately 2-3 teaspoons of blood-tinged sputum per day). He has low-grade evening fever (not documented, feels warm every evening) with drenching night sweats requiring change of clothes. Appetite is markedly reduced with 5 kg weight loss over 6 weeks. He works in a plastics factory with poor ventilation. He shares a small rented room with 3 other migrant workers. One of his roommates was treated for TB 2 years ago but the patient is unsure whether the roommate completed treatment. The patient is a non-smoker, drinks alcohol occasionally (country liquor on weekends). No prior history of TB, diabetes, asthma, or any chronic illness. No HIV risk factors. No history of ATT intake previously. No significant family history. He has not taken any treatment except over-the-counter cough syrups from a local pharmacy."

Oral cavity is normal. Chest examination: Inspection shows reduced movement on the right upper chest. Palpation confirms reduced expansion on the right side superiorly. Percussion reveals impaired note (dull) over the right suprascapular and infraclavicular areas. Auscultation: Bronchial breath sounds with post-tussive coarse crepitations heard over the right upper zone (suprascapular and infraclavicular region). Left lung is clear. Cardiovascular examination is normal with no murmurs. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no organomegaly. No focal neurological deficits."

      "Upper lobe predilection (especially posterior segment of right upper lobe) and cavitation are hallmarks of post-primary (reactivation/adult-type) pulmonary TB due to higher oxygen tension in apices favoring mycobacterial growth",
      "Under India's NTEP (National TB Elimination Programme), all newly diagnosed drug-sensitive TB patients receive a fixed-dose combination (FDC) regimen: 2 months intensive phase (HRZE) + 4 months continuation phase (HRE), with daily dosing and Nikshay notification is mandatory"
    ],
    "atypical_features": "This is a straightforward beginner-level case with classic presentation of pulmonary TB. The minor challenge lies in recognizing the epidemiological link (close contact with a prior TB patient whose treatment completion is uncertain), appreciating the importance of GeneXpert for ruling out drug resistance upfront, and recalling the need for contact screening of the patient's three roommates under NTEP guidelines.",
