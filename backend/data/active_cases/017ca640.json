She was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis on a DEXA scan, which was surprising given her premenopausal status. She also reports increased thirst, frequent urination, and constipation.",

She reports diffuse bone pain in the lower back, hips, and shins, worsening over months. Proximal muscle weakness \u2014 difficulty climbing stairs and getting up from the floor. Increased thirst (polydipsia, ~4-5 liters/day) and polyuria. Chronic constipation for 6 months (no blood in stool). Poor appetite, nausea, and 4 kg weight loss. Episodes of confusion and low mood \u2014 family reports personality change. No history of neck surgery or irradiation. No lithium, thiazide diuretic, or calcium/vitamin D supplement use. No family history of endocrine tumors or kidney stones. No history of peptic ulcer disease. Premenopausal \u2014 regular menses until 4 months ago when she developed oligomenorrhea."

Neck examination: A small, firm, mobile, non-tender nodule (~1.5 cm) palpable in the right lower neck, posterior to the thyroid lobe \u2014 not moving with swallowing (suggestive of parathyroid origin rather than thyroid). Cardiovascular: Shortened QT interval on bedside rhythm strip. Abdomen: Mild bilateral renal angle tenderness. No hepatosplenomegaly. Musculoskeletal: Proximal muscle weakness (grade 4/5 in hip flexors and deltoids), no fasciculations, normal reflexes. Neuropsychiatric: Mildly depressed affect, psychomotor slowing, oriented to time/place/person. Skin: No caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, no subcutaneous nodules."

      "Primary hyperparathyroidism presents with the classic mnemonic 'Bones, Stones, Abdominal Groans, and Psychiatric Moans' \u2014 this patient demonstrates all four components (osteoporosis/subperiosteal resorption, nephrolithiasis, constipation/nausea, depression/confusion).",
      "In PHPT, both calcium AND PTH are elevated (or PTH is inappropriately normal for the high calcium). In malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, PTH is suppressed (<20 pg/mL). This distinction is critical for diagnosis.",
      "24-hour urine calcium >200 mg/day (or calcium-creatinine clearance ratio >0.02) helps differentiate PHPT from familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), where urine calcium is low \u2014 important because FHH does NOT require surgery.",
      "Concurrent vitamin D deficiency (extremely common in India) can mask the severity of PHPT by lowering the serum calcium and raising PTH further. Vitamin D should be cautiously repleted before or after parathyroidectomy. In India, PHPT often presents with more severe skeletal disease (osteitis fibrosa cystica) compared to the West, partly due to coexisting vitamin D deficiency."
    ],
    "atypical_features": "This case is challenging because: (1) The patient is premenopausal, which makes the finding of severe osteoporosis unexpected and should prompt evaluation for secondary causes. (2) Coexisting vitamin D deficiency \u2014 very common in India \u2014 complicates interpretation as it can worsen bone disease and elevate PTH further, raising the question of whether the elevated PTH is simply secondary to vitamin D deficiency (but the markedly elevated calcium rules this out). (3) The palpable neck nodule mimicking a thyroid nodule could mislead the clinician \u2014 parathyroid adenomas are rarely palpable and when they are, parathyroid carcinoma must be considered (though imaging and biochemistry here favor adenoma). (4) MEN1 must be excluded in a young patient with PHPT \u2014 screening for pituitary and pancreatic tumors is warranted.",
