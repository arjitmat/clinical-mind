        "info": "The patient developed a dry cough 6 weeks ago that gradually became productive with yellowish-white mucopurulent sputum, approximately one tablespoon per day. He noticed blood streaks in the sputum 5 days ago (not frank hemoptysis). He has had low-grade fever (documented up to 100.5\u00b0F) mostly in the evenings, associated with drenching night sweats requiring change of clothes. He reports loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss of about 5 kg over the past 6 weeks. There is no chest pain, breathlessness at rest, or leg swelling. He has no history of asthma, diabetes, or hypertension. He is a non-smoker and occasional alcohol consumer. He works as a tailor in a small poorly ventilated workshop with 8 other workers. His elder brother was treated for pulmonary tuberculosis 2 years ago (completed 6 months of ATT successfully). The patient did not undergo screening at that time. He is not on any medications. No history of recent travel. No HIV risk factors identified."

Respiratory examination: Chest is bilaterally symmetrical but chest expansion is slightly reduced on the right upper zone. Percussion note is impaired over the right suprascapular and infraclavicular areas. Auscultation reveals bronchial breath sounds and post-tussive coarse crepitations over the right upper zone (infraclavicular and suprascapular regions). Vocal resonance is increased over the same area. The left lung is clear. Cardiovascular, abdominal, and neurological examination is unremarkable."

HIV ELISA: Non-reactive. Sputum for AFB (two early morning samples): Smear positive (1+ on ZN staining in both samples). Sputum GeneXpert MTB/RIF: Mycobacterium tuberculosis DETECTED, Rifampicin resistance NOT detected. Chest X-ray (PA view): Inhomogeneous opacity with a small cavity (approximately 2 cm) in the right upper zone, no pleural effusion, no mediastinal widening. Left lung field is clear.

      "The classic triad of pulmonary TB includes chronic cough (>2 weeks), evening fever with night sweats, and significant weight loss. Any cough >2 weeks in India should prompt sputum examination for TB.",

      "Drug-sensitive pulmonary TB is treated with the standard regimen under NTEP: Intensive phase (2 months) \u2014 HRZE (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol) followed by Continuation phase (4 months) \u2014 HRE, given daily (daily fixed-dose combination).",
      "Close household contacts of TB patients (especially children <6 years and immunocompromised individuals) must be screened for active TB and offered TB preventive therapy (TPT) if no active disease is found. This patient himself was an unscreened household contact."

    "atypical_features": "This is a relatively straightforward presentation of pulmonary TB in a young adult, making it a classic beginner-level case. The key diagnostic clue is the close household contact (brother treated for TB 2 years ago) combined with constitutional symptoms. The case reinforces the importance of contact screening \u2014 the patient himself was a missed contact who could have benefited from TB preventive therapy earlier.",
