He reports a weight loss of approximately 5 kg over the past 2 months and drenching night sweats requiring him to change his clothes.",

Blood streaking in sputum noted for the past 5 days (approximately one teaspoon per episode). Low-grade fever, predominantly in the evenings, reaching up to 100-101\u00b0F, relieved partially by paracetamol. Drenching night sweats for 2 weeks. Loss of appetite with weight loss of ~5 kg in 2 months. Mild exertional dyspnea on climbing stairs (new onset). No chest pain, no wheezing. No history of contact with a diagnosed TB patient initially, but on detailed probing, his office colleague was diagnosed with pulmonary TB 6 months ago and was on ATT. Patient is a non-smoker, occasional social drinker. No diabetes, no HIV risk factors. No previous history of TB or ATT. No history of asthma or allergies. He lives in a shared rented room with 3 other colleagues. BCG scar present on left deltoid."

BCG scar present on left deltoid. Oral cavity: normal. Chest examination: Inspection - normal shape, bilateral symmetrical chest movements. Palpation - reduced vocal fremitus in the right supra- and infraclavicular regions. Percussion - impaired note in the right supraclavicular and infraclavicular areas. Auscultation - bronchial breath sounds with post-tussive coarse crepitations heard in the right upper zone (supra- and infraclavicular). Rest of the lung fields: normal vesicular breath sounds. Cardiovascular: S1S2 normal, no murmur. Abdomen: soft, non-tender, no organomegaly."

      "The classic triad of pulmonary TB includes chronic cough (>2 weeks), evening rise of fever with night sweats, and weight loss/anorexia. Hemoptysis is an important red flag symptom requiring urgent sputum evaluation.",
      "GeneXpert MTB/RIF is the initial diagnostic test recommended by NTEP (National TB Elimination Programme) for presumptive TB cases \u2014 it detects MTB DNA and rifampicin resistance simultaneously within 2 hours.",
      "Right upper zone involvement with cavitation on chest X-ray is the most characteristic radiological pattern of reactivation/post-primary pulmonary TB due to high oxygen tension in the lung apices.",
      "Under NTEP, all newly diagnosed drug-sensitive pulmonary TB patients are started on a fixed-dose combination (FDC) regimen: Intensive phase \u2014 2 months of HRZE (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol), followed by Continuation phase \u2014 4 months of HRE. All patients must be notified on the Nikshay portal and offered HIV testing."
    ],
    "atypical_features": "This is a straightforward beginner-level case with a classic presentation of pulmonary TB. The mild challenge lies in eliciting the history of TB contact (office colleague rather than a household member), which students may overlook. The case reinforces the importance of systematic history-taking including occupational and social contact history in any patient presenting with chronic cough in the Indian setting.",
