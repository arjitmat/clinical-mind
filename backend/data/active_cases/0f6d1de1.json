He appears thin and fatigued, and mentions that a co-worker in his tailoring workshop was recently diagnosed with tuberculosis.",

        "info": "The patient reports a cough that started as dry 6 weeks ago but became productive with yellowish sputum over the past 3 weeks. He noticed streaks of blood in the sputum for the last 10 days, approximately 2-3 episodes per day, small volume (less than a teaspoon each time). He has low-grade fever predominantly in the evenings (self-recorded up to 100.5\u00b0F), drenching night sweats requiring change of clothes, and has lost approximately 6 kg over 6 weeks. He has poor appetite and generalized weakness. He has no history of breathlessness at rest but gets winded climbing stairs. No chest pain. No previous history of TB or ATT intake. No diabetes, no asthma, no prior hospitalizations. He is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. He works as a tailor in a small, poorly ventilated workshop with 8 other workers. His co-worker sitting adjacent to him was diagnosed with sputum-positive pulmonary TB 2 months ago and is currently on ATT. The patient lives in a one-room house with his wife and two young children. No BCG scar visible. No history of immunosuppressive drugs or HIV risk factors."

      "The classic triad of pulmonary TB includes chronic cough (>2 weeks), hemoptysis, and constitutional symptoms (evening fever, night sweats, weight loss). Upper lobe predilection with cavitation on CXR is characteristic.",
      "GeneXpert MTB/RIF (CBNAAT) is the initial diagnostic test recommended by NTEP for all presumptive TB cases - it simultaneously detects MTB and rifampicin resistance within 2 hours, guiding treatment decisions.",
      "Under NTEP (National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme), this patient qualifies as a new sputum-positive case and should be started on the standard regimen: 2 months intensive phase (HRZE - Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol) followed by 4 months continuation phase (HRE), using daily fixed-dose combinations.",
      "Close contact tracing is essential - the patient's wife and two young children must be screened for TB (symptom screening, chest X-ray, and TST/IGRA for children). Under NTEP, TB preventive therapy (TPT) with Isoniazid or 3HP regimen should be offered to eligible contacts, especially children under 5 years."

    "atypical_features": "This is a straightforward beginner-level case with classic presentation of pulmonary TB. The key clinical reasoning challenge is recognizing the epidemiological link (close contact with a confirmed TB patient in a poorly ventilated workspace), correlating the classic symptoms and examination findings to the correct diagnosis, and understanding the importance of GeneXpert as the first-line diagnostic test. Students must also think about contact tracing and public health notification as part of complete case management.",
