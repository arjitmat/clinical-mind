        "info": "The patient was in his usual state of health until 6 weeks ago when he noticed progressive unsteadiness while walking, initially bumping into doorframes, now requiring support. Binocular horizontal diplopia appeared 5 weeks ago, worse on looking to the left. Numbness and paresthesias began in both feet 3 weeks ago and have ascended to mid-thigh, described as 'ants crawling.' Urinary urgency progressed to two episodes of frank incontinence last week. His wife reports significant personality change \u2014 irritability, emotional lability (episodes of unprovoked crying), and poor short-term memory. He also describes a tight 'band-like' sensation around his trunk at the level of the umbilicus for 2 weeks. Past medical history: No prior neurological episodes (specifically asked \u2014 denies any transient visual, motor, or sensory symptoms). However, on detailed probing, he recalls a 2-week episode of 'blurry vision' in his left eye 2 years ago which he attributed to eye strain and never sought medical attention for \u2014 it resolved on its own. No history of TB, diabetes, hypertension, or autoimmune disease. He is a strict vegetarian. No alcohol or tobacco use. No recent travel. Family history: Elder sister diagnosed with hypothyroidism. No family history of neurological disease. He has been taking vitamin B12 supplements from a local chemist for 1 month without improvement."

      "Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) in a young adult is highly suggestive of multiple sclerosis \u2014 it results from a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) and presents as impaired adduction of the ipsilateral eye with nystagmus of the contralateral abducting eye, with preserved convergence.",
      "The 2017 McDonald criteria allow diagnosis of MS at first clinical presentation if MRI shows dissemination in space (\u22652 of 4 regions: periventricular, cortical/juxtacortical, infratentorial, spinal) AND dissemination in time (simultaneous enhancing and non-enhancing lesions, OR CSF-specific oligoclonal bands can substitute for DIT).",
      "Cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms (memory impairment, emotional lability, personality change) occur in 40-70% of MS patients and can be an early feature \u2014 they are often underrecognized and should be actively screened using bedside tools like MMSE, MoCA, or the Symbol Digit Modalities Test.",
      "In the Indian context, NMOSD is relatively more common than in Western populations and must be excluded by anti-AQP4 and anti-MOG antibody testing, as its treatment (rituximab, azathioprine) differs significantly from MS \u2014 using MS disease-modifying therapies like interferon-beta or fingolimod in NMOSD can worsen disease."
    ],
    "atypical_features": "This case is challenging because: (1) The patient presents with a subacute progressive multifocal syndrome mimicking a single progressive episode rather than classic discrete relapses, requiring careful history-taking to uncover the prior episode of left eye blurring 2 years ago which reframes the diagnosis as relapsing-remitting rather than primary progressive MS. (2) The prominent cognitive and behavioral changes at age 34 with spinal cord involvement may initially raise suspicion for NMOSD, neurosarcoidosis, or CNS vasculitis. (3) The combination of INO, myelopathy, and cognitive symptoms simultaneously creates a diagnostic challenge \u2014 the INO specifically localizes to the brainstem (MLF) and is a critical clinical clue pointing toward MS. (4) The patient's self-treatment with B12 and the vegetarian diet may initially mislead toward subacute combined degeneration, but the normal B12 level, upper motor neuron signs, and MRI findings redirect to demyelination. (5) Indian students must recognize the importance of testing anti-AQP4 and anti-MOG antibodies before committing to an MS diagnosis given the different epidemiological profile in South Asia.",
