He reports that the fever comes every alternate day with drenching sweats and he feels relatively well between episodes.",

Each episode begins with intense chills and shivering lasting 30-60 minutes, followed by high fever (up to 104\u00b0F) for 4-6 hours, then profuse sweating with defervescence. He feels almost normal between febrile episodes. Associated severe frontal headache, myalgia, and mild nausea. No vomiting, diarrhea, cough, rash, or bleeding manifestations. No altered sensorium or seizures. He recently returned 10 days ago from a college trip to Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand (forested area) where they stayed in tents for 4 days with minimal mosquito protection. No prior history of malaria. No significant past medical history. No drug allergies. Lives in a hostel in Varanasi. No history of similar illness in hostel roommates."
