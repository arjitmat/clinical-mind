    "initial_presentation": "A 34-year-old government clerk from Lucknow presents with progressive weakness and stiffness in both lower limbs for 6 weeks, making it increasingly difficult to walk. He reports urinary retention requiring catheterization twice in the past week. He also describes episodes of excruciatingly painful extensor spasms in both legs triggered by minor stimuli like bedsheet contact. He had an episode of transient bilateral visual blurring 3 months ago that resolved without treatment.",

Painful tonic spasms in both legs (lasting 30-60 seconds) triggered by touch, noise, or movement \u2014 occurring 8-10 times/day. Urinary retention for 2 weeks \u2014 required intermittent catheterization twice. Constipation for 3 weeks. Episode of bilateral visual blurring with mild eye pain 3 months ago, lasted 10 days, resolved spontaneously \u2014 did not seek medical attention. Persistent band-like tightness around the lower chest and upper abdomen for the past 4 weeks (girdle sensation). Intractable hiccups for 5 days (new symptom). No limb numbness but describes 'electric shock' sensation running down spine and into legs on neck flexion. No fever, no weight loss, no joint pains, no oral/genital ulcers, no skin rash. No recent vaccination or diarrheal illness. Non-smoker, occasional alcohol. No family history of neurological illness. No history of tuberculosis or contact. He is of Indian ethnicity, Hindu, vegetarian."

      "NMOSD with AQP4-IgG positivity requires only ONE core clinical characteristic (optic neuritis, LETM, area postrema syndrome, diencephalic syndrome, brainstem syndrome, or cerebral syndrome) for diagnosis \u2014 this patient has THREE (LETM, area postrema syndrome with intractable hiccups, and bilateral optic neuritis).",
      "Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (\u22653 vertebral segments) is a hallmark of NMOSD and should trigger AQP4 antibody testing \u2014 unlike MS which typically causes short-segment (<2 vertebral segments) cord lesions. Central cord involvement (grey matter-predominant) is characteristic of NMOSD versus peripheral/dorsal cord in MS.",
      "Area postrema syndrome (intractable nausea, vomiting, or hiccups) is a highly specific presentation of NMOSD and may be the first or presenting feature. The area postrema is an AQP4-rich circumventricular organ lacking blood-brain barrier \u2014 explaining vulnerability in NMOSD.",
      "Treatment of NMOSD differs critically from MS: azathioprine, mycophenolate, rituximab, eculizumab, satralizumab, or inebilizumab for relapse prevention. Interferon-beta and fingolimod (MS drugs) can WORSEN NMOSD. Acute attacks require high-dose IV methylprednisolone and plasma exchange (PLEX) if steroid-refractory. In India, rituximab and azathioprine are most commonly used due to cost considerations.",
      "OCB pattern helps differentiate: Type 2 (CSF-restricted) OCBs are seen in >90% of MS but only 15-30% of NMOSD. Mirror pattern (Type 4 \u2014 identical bands in CSF and serum) suggests systemic immune activation, more consistent with NMOSD. Cell-based assay for AQP4-IgG is more sensitive and specific than ELISA."
    ],
    "atypical_features": "This case is challenging because the combination of periventricular brain lesions (mimicking MS Dawson fingers), positive Lhermitte sign, and spastic paraparesis can easily lead to a misdiagnosis of MS. However, several red flags against MS and pointing to NMOSD include: (1) longitudinally extensive cord lesion (>3 segments \u2014 rare in MS), (2) area postrema lesion causing intractable hiccups, (3) bilateral optic neuritis rather than unilateral, (4) painful tonic spasms (common in NMOSD due to extensive cord involvement), (5) mirror pattern OCBs rather than CSF-restricted bands, and (6) weakly positive ANA suggesting autoimmune predisposition. The co-existence of brain lesions can occur in up to 60% of NMOSD patients and does not exclude the diagnosis. Misdiagnosing as MS and starting interferon-beta could catastrophically worsen the disease. The case also tests knowledge of NMOSD-specific acute management (PLEX) and long-term immunosuppression distinct from MS disease-modifying therapies.",
