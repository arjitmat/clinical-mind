He has generalized body aches, headache, nausea, and 2 episodes of non-bilious vomiting. No cough, sore throat, rash, burning micturition, or diarrhea. No altered sensorium or seizures. He went on an educational trip to Chhattisgarh (Bastar district, a forested malaria-endemic region) 2 weeks ago where he stayed for 5 days in a rural camp without bed nets or mosquito repellent. No significant past medical history. No known drug allergies. No recent antibiotic use. No family members are ill."

      "P. vivax malaria classically presents with alternate-day (tertian) fever with chills, rigors, and sweating; travel history to an endemic area is a critical diagnostic clue",
      "Peripheral smear remains the gold standard for malaria diagnosis \u2014 P. vivax shows enlarged RBCs with Sch\u00fcffner's stippling and ring trophozoites, while RDTs (bivalent) help in rapid field-level diagnosis",
      "Uncomplicated P. vivax malaria is treated with chloroquine (25 mg/kg over 3 days) PLUS primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) for radical cure to eliminate hepatic hypnozoites and prevent relapse \u2014 G6PD testing should be done before prescribing primaquine",

    "atypical_features": "This is a straightforward beginner case with classic features of uncomplicated vivax malaria. The main clinical reasoning challenge lies in eliciting a relevant travel history to a malaria-endemic forested region, correlating the tertian fever pattern with the diagnosis, and distinguishing it from other common causes of acute undifferentiated fever in India such as dengue and typhoid.",
