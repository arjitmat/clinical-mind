    "initial_presentation": "A 28-year-old male auto-rickshaw driver from Jaipur presents with a 3-month history of progressive right hip pain radiating to the anterior thigh and knee. He reports increasing difficulty getting in and out of his auto-rickshaw and has developed a noticeable limp over the past month. He denies any history of trauma but mentions recurrent episodes of sickle cell crises requiring hospitalization in the past.",

        "info": "The patient has been experiencing insidious onset right groin pain for 3 months, dull and aching in nature, radiating to the anterior thigh and occasionally to the right knee. Pain is worse with prolonged sitting (especially during auto-rickshaw driving), weight-bearing, and climbing stairs. He gets partial relief with rest and over-the-counter diclofenac. He reports morning stiffness in the hip lasting about 10 minutes. He has difficulty squatting for Indian-style toilet use and cannot sit cross-legged. He was diagnosed with sickle cell trait (HbAS) at age 12 during a family screening program but was told it was 'nothing serious.' However, he has had 3 episodes of severe bone pain requiring hospitalization in the past 5 years, the last one being 6 months ago involving bilateral leg pain during a dehydration episode in the summer. During his last crisis, he was treated with IV fluids, analgesics, and oxygen at a district hospital for 4 days. He denies any history of corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, smoking, or trauma. No history of SLE, nephrotic syndrome, or organ transplant. He has no family history of hip problems but his younger brother has sickle cell disease (HbSS). He works 10-12 hours daily driving his auto-rickshaw, which is the sole source of income for his family."

Examination of the right hip: flexion 95 degrees (restricted, normal 120), internal rotation markedly reduced to 10 degrees (normal 40) with pain at end range \u2014 this is the earliest and most sensitive finding, external rotation 25 degrees (reduced), abduction 30 degrees (mildly reduced), adduction normal. FIRA (flexion-internal rotation-adduction) test is positive \u2014 reproduces deep groin pain. Thomas test reveals a 5-degree fixed flexion deformity on the right. Log roll test is positive with pain on gentle internal and external rotation. Left hip: range of motion is full but internal rotation is slightly reduced to 30 degrees with mild discomfort at the end range \u2014 suspicious for early contralateral involvement. True limb lengths are equal bilaterally. No distal neurovascular deficit. Knee and spine examination are unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly on abdominal examination. Mild pallor present. No jaundice. No lymphadenopathy."

    "learning_points": [
      "AVN is classically associated with corticosteroid use and alcohol, but sickle cell hemoglobinopathies (including sickle cell trait under physiological stress) are an important cause in the Indian tribal belt of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra. Vaso-occlusive crises cause microvascular thrombosis in the femoral head's tenuous blood supply, leading to ischemia and bone necrosis.",
      "Sickle cell trait (HbAS) is generally considered benign, but under conditions of severe dehydration, hypoxia, acidosis, or extreme physical exertion, it can cause vaso-occlusive episodes and AVN \u2014 this is a frequently tested and commonly missed association. AVN in sickle cell trait patients should prompt evaluation of the contralateral hip as bilateral involvement occurs in 40-80% of cases.",
      "The Ficat and Arlet classification guides management: Stage I/II (pre-collapse) \u2014 head-preserving procedures like core decompression with or without bone grafting or vascularized fibular graft; Stage III (subchondral collapse with maintained joint space) \u2014 core decompression may still be attempted for small lesions (Kerboul angle <200\u00b0), but total hip arthroplasty (THA) is often required for large lesions; Stage IV \u2014 THA is the definitive treatment.",
      "MRI is the gold standard for early diagnosis of AVN (sensitivity >95%). The 'double line sign' on T2-weighted images (inner bright line of granulation tissue and outer dark line of sclerotic bone) is pathognomonic. The modified Kerboul combined necrotic angle (sum of necrotic angles on mid-coronal and mid-sagittal MRI) is a key prognostic tool: <200\u00b0 suggests a better outcome with head-preserving surgery, while >200\u00b0 has a high likelihood of progression to collapse."
    ],
    "atypical_features": "This case is challenging because AVN is occurring in a young man with sickle cell trait (HbAS), which is often dismissed as a benign carrier state. Students may focus on more common causes of AVN (steroids, alcohol) and miss the hemoglobinopathy association. The referred pain to the knee may initially mislead toward a knee pathology. Additionally, the bilateral but asymmetric involvement requiring different treatment strategies for each hip (head-preserving vs. arthroplasty) adds clinical complexity. The early contralateral hip involvement detected only on MRI emphasizes the importance of screening the opposite hip in all AVN cases.",
