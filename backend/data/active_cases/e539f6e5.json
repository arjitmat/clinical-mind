He was referred from urology after his third episode of renal colic, with the urologist noting persistently elevated serum calcium levels on routine workup.",

Diffuse bone pain in lumbar spine, bilateral tibiae, worsening over 6 months. Generalized weakness and fatigue limiting work. Increased thirst and polyuria for 4 months (urine output ~3-4 L/day). Constipation \u2014 chronic, worsened recently. Loss of appetite with 4 kg unintentional weight loss. Occasional nausea. Mild depressive symptoms (low mood, poor concentration) noticed by wife. No history of fractures. No neck swelling noticed. No family history of kidney stones or endocrine disorders. No lithium use. No excessive calcium or vitamin D supplementation. No history of malignancy, tuberculosis, or sarcoidosis. He takes pantoprazole occasionally for dyspepsia. Non-smoker, occasional alcohol."

Musculoskeletal: Tenderness over lumbar spine and bilateral tibiae on palpation. Proximal muscle weakness \u2014 grade 4/5 in hip flexors bilaterally. Abdomen: Mild bilateral renal angle tenderness. No hepatosplenomegaly. No band keratopathy on slit lamp (later confirmed). Cardiovascular: Short QT interval suspected clinically \u2014 confirmed on ECG."

      "Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is diagnosed by the combination of hypercalcemia with inappropriately elevated or non-suppressed PTH. The most common cause (~85%) is a single parathyroid adenoma.",
      "Classic mnemonic for hypercalcemia symptoms: 'Stones (nephrolithiasis), Bones (osteitis fibrosa cystica), Groans (abdominal \u2014 constipation, nausea, pancreatitis), and Psychic Moans (depression, confusion, fatigue)'. Indian patients often present with advanced bone disease due to concomitant vitamin D deficiency.",
      "Calcium/creatinine clearance ratio >0.02 differentiates PHPT from FHH \u2014 this is critical before surgery. FHH is benign and does NOT require parathyroidectomy. 24-hour urine calcium >250 mg/day also supports PHPT.",
      "Subperiosteal bone resorption (radial aspect of middle phalanges), salt-and-pepper skull, and brown tumors are radiological hallmarks of osteitis fibrosa cystica in severe PHPT \u2014 seen more frequently in the Indian population compared to the West due to delayed diagnosis and coexistent vitamin D deficiency."
    ],
    "atypical_features": "This case is challenging because: (1) the patient presented primarily through urology for recurrent stones, requiring the student to connect nephrolithiasis with a systemic endocrine disorder; (2) coexistent severe vitamin D deficiency (common in India) has exacerbated the skeletal manifestations, producing florid osteitis fibrosa cystica \u2014 a presentation now rarely seen in Western countries but still encountered in India; (3) a palpable parathyroid nodule is unusual and may mislead towards a thyroid pathology; (4) the mild renal impairment and hypertension add complexity to management decisions; (5) the student must distinguish PHPT from FHH using urinary calcium excretion and calcium/creatinine clearance ratio before recommending surgery.",
