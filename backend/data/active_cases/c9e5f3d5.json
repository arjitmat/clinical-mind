Between episodes he feels relatively well but fatigued. Associated headache, nausea, and loss of appetite for 3 days. No vomiting, diarrhea, cough, rash, or bleeding manifestations. No altered sensorium or seizures. No dysuria or joint pain. He recently returned 10 days ago from a college trip to a rural area near Raipur, Chhattisgarh, where he stayed for 1 week. He did not use bed nets or mosquito repellent during the trip. No significant past medical history. No drug allergies. No prior similar episodes."

    "atypical_features": "This is a straightforward beginner-level case with classic tertian fever pattern and typical P. vivax findings. The main clinical reasoning challenge is correlating the travel history to an endemic area (Chhattisgarh) with the periodic fever pattern and splenomegaly to arrive at a clinical suspicion of malaria before investigations confirm it, and distinguishing it from other common causes of acute undifferentiated fever in India such as dengue and typhoid.",
