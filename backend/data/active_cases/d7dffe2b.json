Has had 3 episodes of renal colic \u2014 bilateral, calcium oxalate stones on previous analysis. Reports increased thirst and polyuria for 4-5 months (drinking ~4-5 liters/day). Constipation worsening over 3 months (passes stool once in 3-4 days). Appetite decreased with 6 kg unintentional weight loss. Occasional nausea but no vomiting. Complains of difficulty concentrating and low mood \u2014 wife notes personality changes (irritability, forgetfulness). No history of peptic ulcer disease. No neck swelling noticed. No history of lithium use, thiazide diuretics, or calcium/vitamin D supplementation. No prior neck radiation. No family history of kidney stones, endocrine tumors, or hypercalcemia. No symptoms suggestive of MEN syndromes (no headaches, visual changes, skin lesions, diarrhea). Non-smoker, occasional alcohol."

      "The hallmark biochemical signature is hypercalcemia + hypophosphatemia + INAPPROPRIATELY elevated PTH. A suppressed PTH in hypercalcemia points to non-PTH-mediated causes (malignancy, vitamin D excess, granulomatous disease).",
      "Calcium-creatinine clearance ratio (CCCR) >0.02 differentiates primary hyperparathyroidism from familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (CCCR <0.01 in FHH) \u2014 this distinction is critical as FHH does NOT require surgery.",
      "Concurrent vitamin D deficiency (extremely prevalent in India) in primary hyperparathyroidism can mask the severity of hypercalcemia and worsen bone disease. Vitamin D should be cautiously repleted pre-operatively while monitoring calcium closely, as correction may transiently worsen hypercalcemia. Surgical indications include symptomatic disease, calcium >1 mg/dL above normal, T-score < -2.5, eGFR <60, nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis, or age <50."

    "atypical_features": "This case is challenging because: (1) The patient presents with the full-blown 'classical' syndrome (stones, bones, groans, moans) which is now relatively uncommon even in India, requiring the student to synthesize multi-system involvement into a single unifying diagnosis; (2) Concurrent vitamin D deficiency \u2014 extremely common in Indian patients \u2014 complicates interpretation, as it can worsen skeletal manifestations (elevated ALP, severe bone disease) while paradoxically keeping serum calcium from rising to its 'true' level, and its correction must be carefully managed peri-operatively; (3) The mild CKD (Stage 3a) raises the question of secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism, but the markedly elevated calcium and imaging-concordant parathyroid adenoma confirm primary disease; (4) The presentation mimics malignancy-related hypercalcemia given the weight loss, fatigue, and markedly elevated calcium, requiring careful biochemical differentiation.",
