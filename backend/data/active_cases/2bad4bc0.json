He reports that the fever comes every alternate day with drenching sweats, and he feels relatively well in between episodes.",

He has associated frontal headache, generalized myalgia, nausea, and two episodes of non-bilious vomiting. He denies cough, sore throat, rash, bleeding manifestations, altered sensorium, or seizures. He reports decreased appetite and mild loose stools (2-3 episodes/day, non-bloody). He recently returned 10 days ago from a college trekking trip to Chhattisgarh (Bastar district) where they camped near forested areas for 5 days. He did not use any mosquito repellent or prophylaxis. No significant past medical history. No similar illness in the past. No recent antibiotic use. His roommate who accompanied him on the trip is well. No known drug allergies."

      "P. vivax malaria classically presents with tertian periodicity (fever every 48 hours) with chills, rigors, sweating, and relative well-being between paroxysms; P. vivax infects reticulocytes causing enlarged RBCs with Sch\u00fcffner's stippling on peripheral smear",
      "Both thick smear (higher sensitivity for detection) and thin smear (species identification) should be examined; RDT differentiates falciparum (PfHRP2) from non-falciparum (pLDH/aldolase) malaria",
      "Treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax: Chloroquine (25 mg/kg over 3 days) PLUS Primaquine (0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days) for radical cure to eliminate hypnozoites in the liver and prevent relapse; G6PD testing should be done before starting primaquine to avoid hemolytic anemia",
      "Travel history is crucial \u2014 Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, and northeastern states are high malaria-endemic zones in India; the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) recommends ACT only for P. falciparum, while chloroquine remains first-line for P. vivax in India"
    ],
    "atypical_features": "This is a straightforward beginner-level case with a classic presentation. The slight challenge lies in eliciting a clear travel history to an endemic area (Bastar, Chhattisgarh) which is the key epidemiological clue, and in differentiating vivax from falciparum malaria using smear findings and RDT results, as management differs significantly between the two species.",
