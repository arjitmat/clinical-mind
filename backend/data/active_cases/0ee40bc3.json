Unintentional weight loss of 8 kg (from 58 kg to 50 kg). Recurrent painful oral aphthous ulcers - 3 episodes in 4 months. Intermittent low-grade fever (evening rise). Progressive fatigue and generalized weakness. Diffuse intermittent abdominal pain, predominantly right lower quadrant, non-colicky. No frank blood in stools but occasional mucus. Decreased appetite. Joint pain involving both knees and ankles for 2 months (migratory, non-deforming). Treated with metronidazole, albendazole, doxycycline + folic acid (empirical tropical sprue regimen) for 6 weeks - no improvement. No history of tuberculosis or contact. No travel outside MP. Vegetarian diet. No NSAID use. No family history of IBD or autoimmune disease. Menstrual cycles regular but flow has reduced. No perianal symptoms (no fistula, abscess, or skin tags reported). Non-smoker. No alcohol use."

Rectum and sigmoid: Normal (rectal sparing). Biopsies from terminal ileum and cecum: Non-caseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells, focal cryptitis, preserved goblet cells. No caseating necrosis. No AFB on Ziehl-Neelsen stain. GeneXpert on biopsy tissue: MTB not detected.

      "Differentiating Crohn's disease from intestinal TB is the most critical diagnostic challenge in India. Key features favoring Crohn's: skip lesions, cobblestoning, non-caseating granulomas, negative AFB/GeneXpert, longitudinal ulcers, and rectal sparing. TB favors transverse ulcers, caseating granulomas, AFB positivity, and positive QuantiFERON/Mantoux.",
      "Fecal calprotectin is an excellent non-invasive biomarker to differentiate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from functional bowel disorders like IBS. Values >250 \u00b5g/g strongly suggest mucosal inflammation and warrant colonoscopy.",
      "Extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease (aphthous ulcers, peripheral arthropathy, erythema nodosum, uveitis) may precede or accompany intestinal symptoms and provide important diagnostic clues. Peripheral arthropathy correlates with disease activity.",
      "The Indian Society of Gastroenterology (ISG) recommends that when intestinal TB cannot be excluded, a therapeutic trial of anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) for 8-12 weeks should be considered before starting immunosuppression for presumed Crohn's. If no response to ATT, Crohn's disease is confirmed and treatment with steroids for induction followed by azathioprine/biologics for maintenance is initiated."
    ],
    "atypical_features": "This case is challenging because: (1) In India, ileocecal Crohn's disease closely mimics intestinal tuberculosis - the most important differential in the Indian context. The equivocal Mantoux (common in TB-endemic areas) adds to diagnostic confusion. (2) The patient had been empirically treated for tropical sprue without improvement, representing a common misdiagnosis pathway. (3) Nocturnal diarrhea (an organic red flag) distinguishes this from IBS but can also be seen in TB. (4) The perianal skin tag - a subtle finding the patient was unaware of - is an important Crohn's-specific clue that may be missed on cursory examination. (5) The negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold and absence of caseating granulomas/AFB on biopsy, along with positive ASCA and negative pANCA, help tilt the diagnosis toward Crohn's over TB.",
