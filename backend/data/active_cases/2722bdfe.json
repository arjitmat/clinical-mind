She reports significant weight loss, fatigue, and low-grade fever. She was treated twice with antibiotics (metronidazole and ciprofloxacin) by a local practitioner for presumed amoebic dysentery with only transient improvement.",

Current exacerbation: 10-12 bloody stools per day for 5 days, with urgency, tenesmus, and nocturnal diarrhea (waking up 2-3 times at night). Crampy lower abdominal pain preceding defecation, partially relieved after passing stool. No vomiting. Low-grade fever for 1 week. Unintentional weight loss of 6 kg over 3 months. Increased fatigue and easy bruising. No joint pains, skin rashes, or eye symptoms currently. Treated twice with metronidazole + ciprofloxacin courses by local physician \u2014 initial partial response then relapse.

No family history of IBD or colorectal cancer. Vegetarian diet. Non-smoker, non-alcoholic. Married with one child (uncomplicated delivery 4 years ago). No prior surgeries.

Histology shows crypt architectural distortion, crypt abscesses, and basal plasmacytosis without granulomas.",
      "Fecal calprotectin is an excellent non-invasive biomarker for intestinal inflammation (sensitivity >95% for active IBD). In India, it is increasingly available and useful for monitoring disease activity and response to therapy without repeated colonoscopies.",
      "Erythema nodosum is the most common dermatologic extraintestinal manifestation of UC and correlates with disease activity \u2014 it typically resolves with treatment of the underlying colitis. Other EIMs include pyoderma gangrenosum (independent of disease activity), primary sclerosing cholangitis, and sacroiliitis."

    "atypical_features": "The case is challenging because the patient was repeatedly misdiagnosed as amoebic dysentery (extremely common diagnostic confusion in India where both conditions are prevalent), the partial response to antibiotics delayed the correct diagnosis by 3 months. The presence of erythema nodosum \u2014 a subtle extraintestinal manifestation \u2014 provides an important clinical clue that this is IBD rather than infection. Additionally, the severity meets Truelove and Witts criteria for ASUC requiring urgent inpatient management, and the student must recognize this as a medical emergency rather than outpatient management. The reactive thrombocytosis and markedly elevated fecal calprotectin further reinforce the need to differentiate chronic inflammatory from infectious etiology.",
