Between febrile episodes, the patient feels relatively well. Associated headache (diffuse, throbbing) and generalized myalgia. Mild nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea. No cough, sore throat, rash, or urinary symptoms. No bleeding manifestations. The patient recently visited his uncle's farm in a rural area near Mirzapur district 2 weeks ago, where there were stagnant water bodies and no mosquito nets were used. No significant past medical history. No recent medications other than paracetamol. No known drug allergies. No history of similar episodes in the past. His uncle had a similar fever last monsoon season. No recent travel outside UP."

      "Treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax: Chloroquine (25 mg/kg over 3 days: 10+10+5 mg/kg) PLUS Primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) for radical cure to eliminate hepatic hypnozoites and prevent relapse. G6PD testing should be done before starting primaquine.",
      "In India, P. vivax accounts for approximately 50-60% of malaria cases. NCVBDC (formerly NVBDCP) provides free diagnosis via RDT and treatment through ASHAs and PHCs under the National Framework for Malaria Elimination by 2030."

The mild thrombocytopenia may initially raise concern for dengue, requiring the student to differentiate based on periodicity of fever, peripheral smear findings, and negative dengue serology.",
