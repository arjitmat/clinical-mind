She also reports painful swollen ankles bilaterally and tender red nodular lesions over both shins that appeared 2 weeks ago. She has lost 7 kg in 3 months.",

Crampy left lower quadrant and suprapubic pain, partially relieved after defecation. Urgency and tenesmus prominent. Painful bilateral ankle swelling for 6 weeks \u2014 migratory, affecting ankles and knees, non-deforming. Tender red nodules over both shins for 2 weeks (erythema nodosum). Mouth ulcers (aphthous) recurring for 2 months. Unintentional weight loss of 7 kg. No history of recent travel, antibiotic use, or sick contacts. No family history of IBD or autoimmune conditions. She was previously treated by a local practitioner with metronidazole and ciprofloxacin for 'amoebic dysentery' twice \u2014 brief partial response, then relapse. Non-smoker, no alcohol use. No NSAID use. No history of tuberculosis or TB contact. Menstrual history: Irregular periods for 3 months. No prior surgical history."

      "Ulcerative colitis must be distinguished from intestinal tuberculosis in the Indian setting \u2014 QuantiFERON-TB Gold, absence of granulomas on biopsy, continuous (non-skip) colonic involvement starting from the rectum, and negative TB workup help differentiate. ISG guidelines recommend excluding TB before starting immunosuppression.",
      "Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) of IBD include erythema nodosum and Type 1 peripheral arthropathy (pauciarticular, large joint, correlates with disease activity) \u2014 their presence should raise suspicion for IBD in a patient with chronic bloody diarrhea.",
      "Fecal calprotectin is an excellent non-invasive biomarker to distinguish inflammatory diarrhea from functional diarrhea (IBS). Values >250 \u00b5g/g strongly suggest mucosal inflammation and warrant colonoscopy.",
      "Montreal classification of UC extent: E1 (proctitis), E2 (left-sided \u2014 up to splenic flexure), E3 (extensive/pancolitis). Treatment intensity is guided by both extent and severity (Truelove-Witts criteria). Left-sided UC can be managed with combination oral + topical (rectal) 5-ASA (mesalamine) as first-line therapy."
    ],
    "atypical_features": "The prominent extraintestinal manifestations (erythema nodosum, peripheral arthropathy, aphthous ulcers) dominating the presentation alongside the GI symptoms can mislead toward a primary rheumatological or dermatological diagnosis. Additionally, the repeated misdiagnosis as amoebic dysentery (extremely common in Indian practice) with partial antibiotic response delays the correct diagnosis. The need to rigorously exclude intestinal tuberculosis before initiating immunosuppressive therapy adds a critical diagnostic step unique to the Indian clinical context.",
