He also reports excessive thirst, frequent urination, and constipation. He was referred after an incidentally discovered serum calcium of 13.2 mg/dL during his last renal colic workup.",

He has had progressive diffuse bone pain, especially in the lumbar spine, hips, and shins for 6 months. He notes proximal muscle weakness (difficulty rising from squatting position \u2014 important in Indian context). He has polyuria (4-5 L/day), polydipsia, constipation, poor appetite, and 6 kg weight loss. He reports depressed mood, difficulty concentrating at work, and disturbed sleep for 4 months. He was treated for a peptic ulcer 3 months ago (epigastric pain, antacid-responsive). No family history of kidney stones or endocrine disorders. No history of thiazide use, vitamin D/calcium supplementation, lithium use, or prolonged immobilization. He consumes a mixed diet. He has smoked 5-6 bidis/day for 15 years."

Proximal muscle weakness \u2014 grade 4/5 in hip flexors and shoulder abductors. Mild bilateral renal angle tenderness. No band keratopathy on slit lamp (requested). No signs suggestive of MEN1 (no skin lesions, no visual field defects, no features of Cushing or acromegaly). No abdominal mass. Mild epigastric tenderness. Deep tendon reflexes \u2014 normal.

      "Indications for parathyroidectomy include: serum calcium >1 mg/dL above normal, age <50, T-score \u2264 -2.5 at any site, eGFR <60, nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis, or 24-hr urine calcium >400 mg. This patient meets multiple criteria."
    ],
    "atypical_features": "This case is challenging because the patient presents with the full-blown symptomatic phenotype of primary hyperparathyroidism ('stones, bones, abdominal groans, and psychic moans') which is now rarely seen in Western settings but remains common in India due to delayed diagnosis. The coexistent severe vitamin D deficiency (common in Indian PHPT patients) can mask the degree of hypercalcemia and cause even higher PTH levels \u2014 students must recognize this interplay. Additionally, the mild renal impairment and elevated BP add complexity to perioperative management. The peptic ulcer history may mislead students toward a GI-focused workup rather than recognizing it as part of the hypercalcemia symptom complex.",
