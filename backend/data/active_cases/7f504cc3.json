He also reports intermittent nausea and vague abdominal discomfort. He was recently diagnosed with 'low BP' by a local practitioner and started on oral rehydration salts without improvement.",

Recurrent postural dizziness \u2014 nearly fainted twice while getting up from bed. Weight loss of 6 kg without dieting. Salt craving \u2014 has been adding extra salt to food. Intermittent nausea and vague periumbilical pain, no vomiting or diarrhea. Decreased appetite. No fever, night sweats, or cough. No history of tuberculosis, but a colleague at school was diagnosed with pulmonary TB 2 years ago. No history of autoimmune disease in family. No exogenous steroid use \u2014 specifically denied any injections, creams, or ayurvedic preparations containing steroids. No chronic headache or visual disturbance. He was prescribed fludrocortisone briefly abroad during a trip 6 months ago for 'low cortisol' but stopped it after returning to India as he could not find the medication locally."

      "In India, tuberculosis remains the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency, unlike the West where autoimmune destruction predominates. Bilateral adrenal calcification on CT in the setting of adrenal insufficiency is highly suggestive of tubercular etiology.",
      "Classic triad of Addison's disease: hyperpigmentation (due to high ACTH/MSH), hypotension (due to aldosterone deficiency), and hypoglycemia (due to cortisol deficiency). Hyponatremia with hyperkalemia is the hallmark electrolyte pattern of primary (not secondary) adrenal insufficiency.",
      "An 8 AM cortisol <3 \u03bcg/dL with ACTH >2x upper normal is virtually diagnostic of primary adrenal insufficiency. The ACTH stimulation test (Synacthen test) confirms the diagnosis when cortisol fails to rise above 18 \u03bcg/dL at 30 or 60 minutes.",
      "Mildly elevated TSH in Addison's disease may be due to concomitant autoimmune thyroiditis (APS-2) OR may normalize after glucocorticoid replacement (cortisol deficiency itself can raise TSH). Recheck thyroid function 6-8 weeks after starting hydrocortisone before committing to levothyroxine."

    "atypical_features": "This case challenges students to differentiate tubercular from autoimmune etiology of Addison's disease \u2014 anti-21-hydroxylase antibodies are negative, and bilateral adrenal calcifications with a positive Mantoux and old pulmonary fibrotic lesion point toward tuberculosis as the cause, which is the leading etiology in India. The mildly elevated TSH creates a secondary diagnostic dilemma: is it autoimmune thyroiditis (suggesting APS-2) or merely a consequence of cortisol deficiency? Additionally, the history of brief fludrocortisone use abroad and discontinuation may confuse students into considering iatrogenic adrenal suppression, but the markedly elevated ACTH confirms a primary adrenal process.",
