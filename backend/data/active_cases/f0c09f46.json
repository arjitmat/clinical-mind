He reports evening-rise fever (documented up to 101\u00b0F at home), drenching night sweats requiring him to change clothes, and progressive loss of appetite. He has lost approximately 6 kg over the past 2 months. No breathlessness at rest but mild exertional dyspnea (climbing stairs). No chest pain. He is a non-smoker, non-alcoholic, and vegetarian. He lives in a rented two-room house with his wife and parents. His father was treated for pulmonary tuberculosis 2 years ago and completed 6 months of DOTS treatment successfully. The patient did not undergo any screening at that time. No history of diabetes, HIV risk factors, or immunosuppressive medication use. He has not taken any antibiotics or cough syrups for the current illness."

Chest examination: Inspection shows reduced movement on the right upper chest. Palpation confirms reduced expansion on the right side superiorly. Percussion reveals dullness over the right suprascapular and infraclavicular areas. Auscultation: Bronchial breath sounds with post-tussive coarse crepitations over the right upper zone (mammary area and axillary area). Increased vocal resonance in the same region. Left lung is clear. Cardiovascular, abdominal, and neurological examinations are unremarkable."

    "atypical_features": "This is a straightforward beginner-level case with a classic presentation. The key educational aspect is recognizing the importance of household contact history (father treated for TB 2 years ago) and the systematic approach to diagnosis using sputum AFB and GeneXpert as per NTEP guidelines. The mild anemia and elevated ESR are supportive but non-specific findings that students should interpret in context.",
