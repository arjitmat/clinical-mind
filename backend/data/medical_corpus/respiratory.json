    "india_context": "VTE (venous thromboembolism) is underdiagnosed in India with an estimated incidence of 17-26 per 100,000. Prolonged train travel (common in India with journeys exceeding 24-48 hours) is an important but often overlooked risk factor for DVT/PE. OCP use is increasing among urban Indian women. CTPA access is limited to tertiary centers; many district hospitals rely on clinical scoring and D-dimer. Thrombolysis with streptokinase is commonly used in India as it is cheaper than alteplase."

Bidi and cigarette smoking remain the primary risk factors. Occupational exposures (asbestos in construction, jute mills, ship-breaking in Gujarat/West Bengal) contribute significantly. Most patients present at advanced stages (Stage III/IV) due to lack of screening programs. ICMR guidelines recommend concurrent chemoradiation for unresectable Stage III disease. Immunotherapy (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) access is improving but cost remains a barrier (Rs 3-4 lakh per cycle without insurance)."
