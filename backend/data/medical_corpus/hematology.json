Bone marrow examination is more commonly performed in Indian practice than in Western settings, partly due to higher prevalence of acute leukemia in the differential and medico-legal considerations.

Peripheral smear: Microcytic hypochromic anemia, no schistocytes, no abnormal cells. Iron studies: Serum ferritin 14 ng/mL (low), transferrin saturation 12% (low). Coagulation: PT 13 seconds (normal), aPTT 38 seconds (mildly prolonged, normal <34). Bleeding time (Ivy method): 12 minutes (prolonged, normal 2-9 minutes). PFA-100 (Platelet Function Analyzer): Closure time prolonged with both collagen/ADP and collagen/epinephrine cartridges. Von Willebrand studies: vWF antigen (vWF:Ag): 22 IU/dL (low, normal 50-150). vWF ristocetin cofactor activity (vWF:RCo): 18 IU/dL (low, normal 50-150). Factor VIII activity: 35% (mildly reduced — vWF is the carrier protein for FVIII). vWF:RCo/vWF:Ag ratio: 0.82 (>0.7, consistent with Type 1 VWD — concordant reduction). vWF multimer analysis: All multimer sizes present in reduced quantity (normal multimer pattern — confirms Type 1). Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA): Reduced aggregation at standard concentration (1.25 mg/mL), normal at high concentration (rules out Type 2B). Blood group: O positive (relevant as Type O individuals have 25-30% lower vWF levels). ISTH-BAT (Bleeding Assessment Tool) score: 8 (significant — score >6 in adult women is abnormal and warrants investigation). Pelvic ultrasound: Normal uterus and ovaries, no fibroids or polyps.",
    "diagnosis": "Von Willebrand disease Type 1 (most common inherited bleeding disorder) presenting with menorrhagia, mucocutaneous bleeding, and post-procedural hemorrhage",
    "differentials": ["Von Willebrand disease (Type 1, 2, or 3)", "Platelet function disorder (Glanzmann thrombasthenia, Bernard-Soulier syndrome)", "Mild hemophilia A carrier state (symptomatic carrier)", "Acquired von Willebrand syndrome", "Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (diagnosis of exclusion)", "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (connective tissue fragility)"],
    "learning_points": [
      "Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder worldwide, affecting approximately 1% of the population; Type 1 (partial quantitative deficiency of vWF) accounts for 70-80% of cases and follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern",
      "VWF has dual hemostatic functions: (1) mediates platelet adhesion to injured subendothelium (primary hemostasis) and (2) serves as the carrier protein for Factor VIII, protecting it from proteolytic degradation — deficiency therefore causes both platelet-type (mucocutaneous) and coagulation-type bleeding",
      "VWD classification: Type 1 (partial quantitative deficiency, all multimers present), Type 2A (loss of large multimers, reduced function), Type 2B (gain-of-function with spontaneous platelet binding, thrombocytopenia), Type 2M (decreased function, normal multimers), Type 2N (decreased FVIII binding, mimics mild hemophilia A), Type 3 (complete absence, severe bleeding)",
      "Blood group O individuals have 25-30% lower baseline vWF levels; diagnosis of Type 1 VWD in blood group O patients can be challenging as levels may overlap with the lower end of normal — repeat testing and clinical correlation (ISTH-BAT score) are essential",
      "Treatment of VWD Type 1: Desmopressin (DDAVP) 0.3 mcg/kg IV is first-line — it releases stored vWF and FVIII from endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies, typically raising levels 3-5 fold; a DDAVP trial should be performed to confirm responsiveness; for major surgery or DDAVP-unresponsive patients, vWF-containing FVIII concentrates (Humate-P) are used",
      "Tranexamic acid (antifibrinolytic) is an effective adjunct for mucosal bleeding and menorrhagia in VWD; combined oral contraceptive pills increase vWF levels and are used to manage menorrhagia in women with VWD — a combined hematology-gynecology approach is ideal"
    ],
    "india_context": "VWD is significantly underdiagnosed in India, particularly in women where menorrhagia is often normalized or attributed to iron deficiency without investigating the underlying cause. The ICMR-funded multicenter study on inherited bleeding disorders estimated that only 5-10% of VWD patients in India are diagnosed. Specialized coagulation laboratories capable of performing vWF antigen, activity, multimer analysis, and RIPA are limited to major tertiary centers (AIIMS Delhi, CMC Vellore, PGIMER Chandigarh, KEM Mumbai, SGPGI Lucknow). Desmopressin (DDAVP) is available and affordable in India and is the mainstay of treatment for Type 1 VWD. VWF-containing factor concentrates (Humate-P, Wilate) are available but expensive and not stocked at most government hospitals. The Hemophilia Federation of India (HFI) has expanded its mandate to include VWD awareness and registration. Indian gynecologists are increasingly being trained to screen for bleeding disorders in women with menorrhagia, as recommended by FOGSI guidelines. Adolescent girls with heavy periods since menarche should be screened with a bleeding assessment tool and basic coagulation tests before being labeled as having dysfunctional uterine bleeding."
