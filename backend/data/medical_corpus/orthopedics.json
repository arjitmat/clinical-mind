The Indian Orthopaedic Association recommends cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty for displaced femoral neck fractures in the elderly. Post-fracture mortality at 1 year in Indian elderly is 25-30%, highlighting the need for comprehensive geriatric hip fracture programs."

Two-wheeler riders constitute 40% of road traffic fatalities, and lack of protective gear is a major contributing factor. Open tibial fractures are extremely common due to the subcutaneous location of the tibia. Delayed presentation to tertiary trauma centers (average 6-12 hours in rural India) increases infection rates. The Indian Orthopaedic Association ATLS-equivalent training (IATSIC courses) and trauma system development are ongoing. Many patients first present to unqualified practitioners or bone setters, further delaying definitive surgical care.

The Indian Orthopaedic Association and Association of Spine Surgeons of India (ASSI) emphasize awareness among primary care physicians about red flag signs to enable timely referral. Occupational health regulations regarding safe manual handling are poorly enforced in many Indian industrial settings."

      "The Ponseti method is the gold standard treatment for CTEV: weekly serial manipulation and above-knee plaster casts (typically 5-7 casts over 5-7 weeks), followed by percutaneous Achilles tenotomy in approximately 80-90% of cases to correct residual equinus, followed by foot abduction brace (Denis Browne bar with shoes) worn 23 hours/day for 3 months then night-time only until age 4-5 years",
      "Pirani scoring system (0-6) is used to assess severity and monitor progress during Ponseti casting: Midfoot contracture score (0-3) evaluates medial crease, lateral border curvature, and talar head coverage; Hindfoot contracture score (0-3) evaluates posterior crease, emptiness of heel, and rigidity of equinus - higher score indicates more severe deformity",
      "The most common cause of relapse in CTEV is non-compliance with the foot abduction brace (Denis Browne splint) - parents must be extensively counseled about the importance of brace wear, which is the most critical factor in long-term success",
      "Incidence of CTEV is approximately 1-2 per 1000 live births, male to female ratio is 2:1, bilateral involvement occurs in 50% of cases; the CURE India clubfoot program has treated over 100,000 children using the Ponseti method across India"
    ],
    "india_context": "India has the highest absolute number of clubfoot births globally (approximately 50,000 per year) due to its large population. The CURE India Clubfoot Program, in collaboration with the Indian Orthopaedic Association, has established over 600 Ponseti clinics across India and trained thousands of practitioners in the Ponseti method. Before the Ponseti revolution, extensive corrective surgeries (posteromedial soft tissue release) were the norm, often leaving patients with stiff, painful feet. Traditional bone setters in India often attempt manipulation and splinting of clubfoot with variable and usually poor results, leading to resistant deformities. The Pirani scoring system was specifically validated in Indian settings and is used as the standard assessment tool. India's National Programme for Prevention and Management of Birth Defects includes clubfoot screening at birth. Socioeconomic barriers, particularly in rural areas, remain a challenge for brace compliance during the maintenance phase of treatment."

Spinal TB with paraplegia is still one of the most common causes of non-traumatic paraplegia in India. The RNTCP (now NTEP - National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme) provides free ATT under DOTS strategy with daily fixed-dose combination regimen. Delayed presentation (average 4-6 months in India) due to initial treatment by traditional healers worsens neurological outcomes. The Indian Orthopaedic Association and AO Spine India consensus recommends a minimum of 12-18 months of ATT for spinal TB, longer than the standard 6 months for pulmonary TB. India's goal of TB elimination by 2025 (revised to 2030) under Pradhan Mantri TB Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan requires strengthened screening programs especially in vulnerable tribal communities."

High-dose corticosteroid use for nephrotic syndrome, SLE, organ transplant, and increasingly post-COVID-19 treatment (mucormycosis protocol) has led to a surge in AVN cases in India, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic when indiscriminate steroid use was widespread. The Indian practice of squatting for toileting and sitting cross-legged makes hip AVN particularly disabling and patients present earlier than in Western populations. Total hip replacement in young patients poses the challenge of implant longevity; ceramic-on-ceramic or ceramic-on-highly-cross-linked-polyethylene bearings are preferred. Indian-made hip implants have made THA more affordable, with the Government's price capping under NPPA (National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority) reducing implant costs by 70%.

The Indian Arthroscopy Society promotes training and standardization. Hamstring autograft is the most commonly used graft in Indian practice.

The Sports Authority of India (SAI) and National Sports Injury Centre at Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, provide subsidized sports injury management for national-level athletes. Post-operative rehabilitation infrastructure varies significantly — dedicated sports physiotherapy centers are concentrated in metropolitan cities. The Indian Orthopaedic Association recommends protocol-based rehabilitation with objective return-to-sport criteria."

    "presentation": "A 58-year-old male retired army officer from Bengaluru presents with an 8-month history of progressive difficulty with fine motor tasks involving both hands, an increasingly unsteady gait, and numbness and tingling in both hands. He first noticed difficulty buttoning his shirt and handling small objects (coins, keys) about 8 months ago. Over the following months, his handwriting has deteriorated, he drops objects frequently, and his wife notes that his gait has become broad-based and unsteady. He reports a band-like tightness around both forearms for 4 months. He has also developed urinary urgency and occasional urgency incontinence for the past 2 months. His symptoms have been slowly progressive without any acute worsening. He has a history of chronic neck pain for many years attributed to 'cervical spondylosis' and has been treated conservatively with physiotherapy, NSAIDs, and a cervical collar intermittently. He was referred by a neurologist after a clinical examination suggested cervical myelopathy.",

    "history": "Chronic neck pain for approximately 10 years, managed conservatively with NSAIDs, physiotherapy, and intermittent cervical collar use. Eight months ago: insidious onset of clumsiness in both hands — difficulty with fine motor tasks including buttoning, writing, handling coins, and using a smartphone. Progressive deterioration of handwriting. Drops objects from both hands. Numbness and tingling in all fingers of both hands, more pronounced in the C6-C7 distribution (index, middle, and ring fingers). Band-like sensation around both forearms for 4 months. Gait disturbance: Progressive unsteadiness for 6 months, wife reports a wide-based, spastic pattern. Has stumbled several times, one fall 2 months ago. Urinary symptoms for 2 months: urgency, frequency, and 2-3 episodes of urgency incontinence. No frank bowel incontinence but reports constipation. No history of trauma, falls, or sports injury preceding symptoms. No history of rheumatoid arthritis (important for C1-C2 instability). No diabetes. No alcohol use. No vitamin B12 deficiency symptoms previously evaluated. Former army officer — physically active throughout career, retired 5 years ago.",
    "physical_exam": "Well-built man, walks with a broad-based, spastic gait with short steps. Cervical spine: Reduced range of motion in all directions (flexion, extension, lateral flexion, rotation all reduced by approximately 50%). No tenderness. Spurling test: Positive on the right (reproduces radicular pain in C6 distribution). Upper limbs: Tone — mild spasticity bilaterally. Power — grip strength reduced bilaterally (3+/5), finger abduction and adduction weak (4/5), deltoid and biceps 5/5, wrist extensors 4/5. Hoffman sign: Positive bilaterally (flicking the nail of the middle finger causes involuntary flexion of thumb and index finger — upper motor neuron sign in upper limbs, highly suggestive of cervical myelopathy). Finger escape sign: Positive (when fingers are held in full extension and adduction, the small finger spontaneously abducts and flexes within 30 seconds — myelopathy sign). Grip and release test: Can only perform 15 cycles in 10 seconds (normal >20 — myelopathy marker). Inverted radial reflex: Present (tapping the brachioradialis tendon produces finger flexion instead of normal forearm pronation — indicates C5-C6 cord compression). Deep tendon reflexes: Biceps and brachioradialis slightly diminished (lower motor neuron at C5-C6 compression level), triceps brisk (3+), finger flexors brisk. Lower limbs: Tone — bilateral spasticity. Power — hip flexors 4/5, knee extensors 4/5, ankle dorsiflexion 4/5 bilaterally. Knee jerks 3+ with crossed adductor response. Ankle jerks 3+ with bilateral sustained ankle clonus (>5 beats). Plantars: Extensor bilaterally (Babinski positive). Sensory: Diminished light touch and pinprick in C6-C7-C8 dermatomes bilaterally, impaired joint position sense in toes bilaterally. Romberg test: Positive. Lhermitte sign: Positive (electric shock-like sensation radiating down the spine on neck flexion — indicates posterior column compression). Myelopathy hand: Present — wasting of intrinsic hand muscles (thenar and hypothenar eminences), difficulty with rapid finger movements. Modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score: 11/18 (moderate myelopathy; <12 indicates surgical intervention).",
    "investigations": "X-ray cervical spine AP and lateral: Multilevel degenerative changes with reduced disc height at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7. Posterior osteophytes at C5-C6 and C6-C7. Loss of cervical lordosis (straightening). No listhesis in neutral. Dynamic flexion-extension views: No instability (no pathological translation). Canal diameter estimated <13 mm at C5-C6 (developmental canal stenosis — predisposes to myelopathy). MRI cervical spine (1.5T, with sagittal T1, T2, and axial): Multilevel cervical spondylosis with maximum stenosis at C5-C6 and C6-C7. C5-C6: Large central disc-osteophyte complex causing severe spinal canal stenosis with cord compression, flattening of the spinal cord (anteroposterior diameter 4.2 mm), and T2 hyperintense signal change within the cord at this level (myelomalacia — suggests chronic cord damage). C6-C7: Moderate disc-osteophyte complex with cord indentation but no signal change. C4-C5: Mild stenosis without cord compression. Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy contributing to posterior compression at C5-C6 and C6-C7. CT cervical spine: Confirms large posterior osteophytes and ossification at C5-C6, OPLL (ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament) not present. Electrophysiology: Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP): Prolonged central conduction time. Motor evoked potentials (MEP): Prolonged latency to upper and lower limbs. NCS/EMG: Chronic neurogenic changes in C6-C7 myotomes bilaterally (denervation in distal muscles), superimposed upper motor neuron pattern. Blood: CBC normal, RBS 98, creatinine 0.9, Vitamin B12: 380 pg/mL (normal), TSH: 2.8 (normal), RA factor: Negative, ESR: 18, CRP: 4. DEXA: Normal (no osteoporosis). Urodynamic study: Detrusor overactivity consistent with upper motor neuron bladder.",
    "diagnosis": "Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with T2 signal change (myelomalacia) causing progressive upper and lower limb weakness, myelopathic hand, spastic gait, and neurogenic bladder (mJOA score 11/18 — moderate myelopathy, surgical candidate)",
    "differentials": ["Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults >55)", "Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL — common in East Asian populations, also seen in Indians)", "Multiple sclerosis (relapsing-remitting course, younger age, periventricular lesions on brain MRI)", "Motor neuron disease / ALS (no sensory involvement, no cord compression on MRI, fasciculations, progressive)", "Subacute combined degeneration of the cord (B12 deficiency — posterior column involvement, low B12)", "Spinal cord tumor (intradural/extradural — MRI will differentiate)"],
    "learning_points": [
      "Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults over 55 years; it results from chronic compression of the cervical spinal cord by degenerative changes (disc-osteophyte complexes, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, facet hypertrophy) causing progressive neurological deterioration",
      "Key clinical signs of cervical myelopathy: Hoffman sign (most sensitive screening test for upper limb UMN involvement), inverted radial reflex (pathognomonic of C5-C6 cord compression), finger escape sign, myelopathy hand (intrinsic muscle wasting, difficulty with fine motor tasks, slow grip-release), spastic gait, hyperreflexia with clonus, Babinski sign, and Lhermitte sign",
      "The modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score is the standard assessment tool for CSM severity: 18 = normal, 15-17 = mild, 12-14 = moderate, <12 = severe; surgical decompression is recommended for moderate and severe CSM (mJOA <15) and for progressive myelopathy regardless of mJOA score",
      "T2 hyperintense signal change in the spinal cord on MRI (myelomalacia) indicates chronic cord damage and is an adverse prognostic factor for neurological recovery after surgery; T1 hypointensity in addition suggests irreversible gliosis and is a poor prognostic sign",
      "Surgical approaches for CSM: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for 1-2 level disease, anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) for retrovertebral compression, posterior laminoplasty for multilevel disease with preserved lordosis, posterior laminectomy and fusion for multilevel disease — the choice depends on the number of levels, alignment, and location of compression (anterior vs. posterior)",
      "C5 palsy (postoperative deltoid weakness) is a specific complication of cervical decompression surgery occurring in 5-10% of cases, more common with posterior approaches; it is usually a neurapraxia that recovers in 3-6 months but must be discussed during informed consent"
    ],
    "india_context": "Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a common condition encountered in Indian orthopedic and neurosurgical practice, with a trend toward earlier presentation in the Indian population due to factors such as prolonged computer use in the IT workforce, two-wheeler riding posture, and occupational cervical strain. The Association of Spine Surgeons of India (ASSI) provides clinical practice guidelines for CSM management. Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is the most commonly performed procedure in India for 1-2 level CSM, with Indian-manufactured PEEK cages and titanium plates significantly reducing implant costs compared to imported devices. Posterior cervical surgeries including laminoplasty (originally a Japanese technique suited for multilevel stenosis) are increasingly performed at Indian spine centers. Government price capping of spinal implants under NPPA has improved affordability — ACDF with implants can be performed for Rs 1.5-3 lakh in government hospitals versus Rs 4-8 lakh in private centers. ASSI-certified spine fellowships have expanded training capacity across India. Challenges remain in rural India where spine surgery expertise is limited and patients often present late with advanced myelopathy and poor recovery potential. Ayushman Bharat coverage for spine surgery has improved access for economically weaker sections."
