      "Tinea incognito refers to dermatophyte infection modified by topical corticosteroid misuse — characterized by loss of the typical annular morphology, reduced scaling, and atypical appearance that mimics other dermatoses; always perform KOH in doubtful cases",
      "IADVL Task Force (2021) consensus for chronic/recalcitrant dermatophytosis: Itraconazole 200 mg/day (or 100 mg BD) for 8-12 weeks as preferred systemic antifungal; avoid terbinafine monotherapy in epidemic areas; add sertaconazole or luliconazole topically",
      "The DGCI (now CDSCO) banned fixed-dose combination topical preparations of corticosteroids with antifungals and antibiotics in September 2023 to curb this epidemic; patient education about avoiding OTC steroid creams is essential"
    ],
    "india_context": "The dermatophytosis epidemic in India is considered a public health crisis. An estimated 60-70% of dermatology OPD visits in North and East India are for tinea. The IADVL has constituted a special task force and published consensus statements (2018, 2021). Trichophyton indotineae (previously T. mentagrophytes genotype VIII), first identified in India, has now spread to other countries. The rampant sale of irrational FDC creams over-the-counter (estimated annual market >Rs 2,500 crore) has been a key driver. Despite the CDSCO ban on certain FDCs, enforcement remains challenging. Bihar, UP, West Bengal, and Jharkhand are the worst affected states. Shared living arrangements in joint families, common in Indian culture, facilitate household transmission. The ICMR has funded multicenter studies on antifungal resistance patterns. Patient counseling must address: stopping steroid creams, completing full antifungal course, washing clothes in hot water, not sharing towels, and treating household contacts simultaneously."

    "india_context": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis is an established endemic disease in the Thar Desert region of Rajasthan with periodic outbreaks. Bikaner is a well-documented hotspot. CL is often referred to as 'Delhi boil' or 'Bikaner sore' in Indian literature. Under the NVBDCP (National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme), kala-azar elimination targets exist but CL receives comparatively less policy attention. Sandfly control measures (indoor residual spraying with DDT/synthetic pyrethroids, insecticide-treated bed nets) are recommended. Living in kaccha houses near desert terrain with peridomestic cattle increases risk. The ICMR recommends intralesional SSG as first-line for localized CL. Unlike kala-azar, CL is not a notifiable disease in most Indian states, leading to under-reporting. Cosmetic disfigurement is a significant concern especially for facial lesions in children, emphasizing the need for early treatment to minimize scarring."

      "Distinguishing Type 1 from Type 2 reaction is critical: Type 1 — existing lesions become erythematous, edematous, and tender with acute neuritis (upgrade/downgrade); Type 2 — new crops of nodules appear over 'normal' skin, with systemic features and neutrophilic infiltrate",
      "NLEP guidelines for severe ENL: Prednisolone 40-60 mg/day tapered over 12 weeks; thalidomide 100-300 mg/day is the most effective drug for ENL (dramatically reduces TNF-alpha) but is strictly contraindicated in women of childbearing age due to teratogenicity; clofazimine in anti-inflammatory doses (300 mg/day) can be used as a steroid-sparing agent",

Thalidomide, though highly effective for ENL, requires strict regulation due to teratogenicity — its use in India is restricted under the Thalidomide Protocol with mandatory pregnancy testing and contraception counseling. In practice, corticosteroids remain the mainstay due to thalidomide's limited availability. The key teaching point for NLEP field workers: never stop MDT during a reaction. ENL-related orchitis can lead to testicular atrophy and infertility if untreated — an important but under-discussed complication in young Indian males.

The IADVL and API (Association of Physicians of India) recommend HLA-B*58:01 testing before starting allopurinol, particularly in patients with CKD. In this case, the starting dose of 300 mg/day was too high for a patient with baseline creatinine of 1.4 — guidelines recommend starting at 100 mg/day (or 50 mg/day with CKD) and titrating gradually. Febuxostat (a non-purine xanthine oxidase inhibitor that does not cross-react) is a safer alternative in HLA-B*58:01 positive patients and is available in India. Awareness of DRESS syndrome among non-dermatologist prescribers (orthopedicians, general physicians) needs improvement, as delayed recognition increases mortality.

      "Treatment of active progressive vitiligo: Topical potent corticosteroids (mometasone, clobetasol) or topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus 0.1% — preferred for face and eyelids) combined with NB-UVB phototherapy (narrowband UVB 311 nm, 2-3 times/week for 6-12 months) is the standard of care; systemic mini-pulse corticosteroids (oral betamethasone 5 mg on 2 consecutive days/week — OMP therapy) can halt progression",
      "Surgical options for stable vitiligo (no new lesions for 1-2 years): Non-cultured epidermal cell suspension (NCES), melanocyte-keratinocyte transplantation procedure (MKTP), suction blister grafting, and punch grafting — Indian dermatologists have pioneered NCES technique which is cost-effective and widely performed"
    ],
    "india_context": "Vitiligo prevalence in India is estimated at 0.5-2.5%, higher than the global average. The psychosocial burden of vitiligo is disproportionately severe in India due to the cultural significance of skin color — vitiligo is colloquially called 'safed daag' (white patches) and carries intense stigma, particularly for unmarried women, affecting marriage prospects and social participation. Historically confused with leprosy ('safed kushth'), vitiligo carries the misconception of being contagious. The IADVL has published consensus guidelines (2020) for vitiligo management adapted to Indian settings. NB-UVB phototherapy units are available at most dermatology departments in medical colleges. India is a global leader in surgical vitiligo management — the NCES (non-cultured epidermal cell suspension) technique developed by Indian dermatologists is cost-effective and widely practiced. Oral mini-pulse steroid therapy for arresting disease progression is widely used in India based on strong Indian evidence. The psychological impact requires formal assessment and counseling — referral to a clinical psychologist should be part of routine vitiligo management. Ayurvedic and homeopathic treatments for vitiligo are commonly sought by Indian patients and may cause delays in evidence-based treatment."

    "history": "Three days of prodromal burning pain and paresthesia on the left chest wall before the rash appeared. Initially thought to be cardiac pain — visited cardiologist, ECG normal, cardiac enzymes negative. On day 4, grouped vesicles appeared on erythematous base at the left T5 dermatome. Rash has progressed over 5 days from the posterior axillary line anteriorly toward the sternum, strictly unilateral, not crossing the midline. Vesicles have become cloudy (pustular) and some have ruptured forming erosions with crusting. Pain is severe (8/10), described as burning, stabbing, and electric shock-like, constant with paroxysmal worsening, aggravated by clothing contact (allodynia). Sleep severely disrupted. Appetite decreased. Comorbidities: Type 2 DM for 20 years on insulin glargine 24 units + metformin 1 g BD, HbA1c 9.0% (poorly controlled). Hypertension for 15 years on telmisartan 40 mg + amlodipine 5 mg. No history of immunosuppression, malignancy, HIV, or steroid use. Had chickenpox as a child. No prior episode of herpes zoster. No herpes zoster vaccination. Lives with wife, both children are married and live separately.",

Skin: Grouped vesicles and pustules on erythematous and edematous plaques arranged in a dermatomal distribution along the left T5 dermatome, extending from the left paravertebral region anteriorly to the left nipple area. Lesions are strictly unilateral, not crossing the midline. Some vesicles are intact with clear to turbid fluid; others have ruptured forming shallow erosions with hemorrhagic and serous crusts. Surrounding skin shows edema and erythema. No satellite lesions beyond the dermatome. No vesicles on the tip of the nose (Hutchinson sign negative — rules out V1/nasociliary involvement). No facial nerve involvement (no facial palsy — rules out Ramsay Hunt syndrome). Eyes: No conjunctivitis or keratitis (no ophthalmic zoster). Ears: Normal (no vesicles on pinna).

    "learning_points": [
      "Herpes zoster results from reactivation of latent VZV in dorsal root ganglia; risk factors include advancing age (>50 years), immunosuppression, poorly controlled diabetes, malignancy, and stress; the incidence increases sharply after age 60 as cell-mediated immunity wanes",
      "The classic presentation is a painful, unilateral, dermatomal vesicular eruption that does not cross the midline; prodromal pain precedes the rash by 2-5 days and can mimic angina (thoracic), cholecystitis (abdominal), or renal colic (lumbar), leading to diagnostic confusion",
      "Antiviral therapy must be started within 72 hours of rash onset for maximum benefit: Acyclovir 800 mg 5 times/day for 7 days OR Valacyclovir 1000 mg TDS for 7 days (preferred due to better bioavailability and simpler dosing); in immunocompromised patients, IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg TDS is indicated",
      "Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is defined as pain persisting beyond 90 days after rash onset; risk factors include age >60, severe acute pain, severe rash, ophthalmic involvement, and immunosuppression; it occurs in 30-50% of patients >60 years and can be debilitating for months to years",
      "PHN management follows a stepwise approach: first-line is pregabalin (75-300 mg/day) or gabapentin (300-3600 mg/day), amitriptyline (10-75 mg at bedtime), or topical lidocaine 5% patch/capsaicin 8% patch; opioids (tramadol) are second-line; combination therapy is often required",
      "Vaccination: The recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine (Shingrix, 2 doses) is recommended for adults >50 years and provides >90% protection against herpes zoster and PHN; it is approved in India but uptake remains very low due to cost and lack of awareness"
    ],
    "india_context": "Herpes zoster is common in the Indian elderly population, with the incidence estimated at 3-5 per 1000 person-years in those aged >50. The large burden of poorly controlled diabetes in India (estimated 101 million diabetics per ICMR-INDIAB study) further increases the risk. Prodromal pain before the rash frequently leads to misdiagnosis — cardiac workup for thoracic zoster and surgical consultations for abdominal zoster are common clinical scenarios. Generic acyclovir is widely available and affordable in India (Rs 5-10 per tablet), but valacyclovir (preferred) is more expensive (Rs 30-50 per tablet). Postherpetic neuralgia is undertreated in India, partly because neuropathic pain management is not well-integrated into primary care training. Pregabalin and gabapentin are available as generic formulations in India but are classified under Schedule H1, requiring prescription. The Shingrix vaccine was approved in India in 2023 but costs approximately Rs 12,000-15,000 for the 2-dose series, making it inaccessible for most elderly Indians. IADVL guidelines recommend antiviral therapy for all patients >50 years regardless of rash severity, and aggressive pain management to reduce PHN risk. The Government of India has not yet included zoster vaccination in the national immunization program for the elderly."
