He was driving when a truck collided head-on with a car in the adjacent lane, causing a multi-vehicle pile-up. His car spun off the road and overturned. He sustained rib fractures and a concussion but survived. His colleague in the passenger seat died at the scene. Since the accident, he has vivid recurring nightmares of the collision 3-4 times per week, waking up screaming and drenched in sweat. He avoids driving or even sitting in a car, has taken a leave of absence from work (which requires extensive travel), and becomes extremely anxious and has palpitations when he hears sudden loud noises (horns, braking sounds). He feels emotionally numb, has detached from his wife and children, and reports persistent guilt about surviving when his colleague died.",

Re-experiencing: Vivid nightmares of the accident 3-4 times/week, intrusive flashbacks triggered by traffic sounds or news of road accidents, intense physiological distress (palpitations, sweating, trembling) when exposed to reminders. Avoidance: Refuses to drive or ride in cars, avoids the expressway and roads near the accident site, avoids news about road accidents, stopped socializing with colleagues (reminders of the deceased). Negative alterations in cognition and mood: Persistent survivor's guilt ('Why did I survive and he didn't?'), emotional numbing, detachment from family, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities (cricket, movies), persistent negative beliefs ('The world is dangerous, nowhere is safe'), inability to recall specific details of the moment of impact (dissociative amnesia). Hyperarousal: Insomnia (sleeps only 3-4 hours due to fear of nightmares), hypervigilance (constantly scanning for danger), exaggerated startle response (jumps at loud sounds), irritability (frequent anger outbursts at family).

    "india_context": "Road traffic accidents are the leading cause of trauma-related PTSD in India, with approximately 1.5 lakh road deaths annually (MoRTH data 2022). PTSD following RTAs is significantly underdiagnosed as mental health sequelae are rarely assessed during post-accident medical follow-up. The concept of psychological trauma is poorly understood by the general public in India, and symptoms are often attributed to 'weakness' or dismissed as 'nervousness.' Trained trauma-focused psychotherapists (CBT/PE/EMDR) are scarce in India and concentrated in metropolitan cities. NIMHANS Bengaluru, AIIMS Delhi, and LGBRIMH Tezpur have specialized trauma clinics. The Mental Healthcare Act 2017 provides a framework for mental health services but implementation gaps remain. Generic sertraline (Rs 3-5/day) is affordable but access to prazosin for nightmares and structured psychotherapy remains limited outside major centers. The DMHP (District Mental Health Programme) is gradually incorporating trauma care into its framework."

      "Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is diagnosed when a pattern of use leads to clinically significant impairment with ≥2 of 11 criteria in 12 months (tolerance, withdrawal, craving, larger amounts, failed attempts to cut down, time spent, social/occupational impairment, hazardous use, continued despite problems, activities given up)",
      "THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) acts on CB1 receptors in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, increasing dopamine release — this is the mechanism underlying cannabis-induced psychosis; higher THC potency products carry greater psychosis risk",
      "Approximately 10-15% of patients with cannabis-induced psychosis go on to develop schizophrenia within 3-5 years — longitudinal follow-up is essential, especially in patients with a family history of psychotic disorders; early cannabis use (<16 years) increases schizophrenia risk 4-6 fold",
      "Management of acute cannabis psychosis: Low-dose antipsychotic (haloperidol 2-5 mg or olanzapine 5-10 mg) for symptom control, benzodiazepine for agitation (lorazepam 2 mg), supportive environment; antipsychotics can usually be tapered and stopped within 2-4 weeks if symptoms resolve with abstinence"

    "india_context": "Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance in India, with an estimated 3.1 crore (31 million) users per the AIIMS-NDDTC National Survey on Extent and Patterns of Substance Use in India (2019). Bhang (cannabis-infused drink) is legally sold in many Indian states during festivals like Holi, Maha Shivaratri, and other occasions, and its use is culturally normalized in North India, particularly in Varanasi, Mathura, and Rajasthan. This cultural acceptance makes it harder for young people to recognize problematic use patterns. College campuses are a high-risk environment for cannabis initiation and escalation. The NDPS Act (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985) criminalizes cannabis possession and sale (except bhang in some states), but enforcement is inconsistent. NIMHANS Bengaluru and NDDTC-AIIMS Delhi are leading centers for addiction research and treatment. The Indian Psychiatric Society recommends screening for cannabis use in all young patients presenting with first-episode psychosis. Access to structured de-addiction programs and psychosocial interventions (motivational enhancement therapy, contingency management) remains limited in most Indian cities."
